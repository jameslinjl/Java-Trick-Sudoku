Sudoku

The program here implements the basics of a Sudoku game
but utilizes a bit of sleight of hand in order to get
around some of the more complex parts of randomization.

I know that there should be an algorithm that allows you
to create purely random Sudoku solutions, but to do that
involves a backtracking algorithm and several other more
complex features which I do not have time to implement at
this time (I have other assignments that require my time
unfortunately). As such, I have done some sneaky things
to do pseudo-randomization. I hope you enjoy and it was a
pleasure getting to this little piece of coding for you.
